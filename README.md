Gel-Electrophoresis-Auto-shutoff
================================

Problem: Difficult to gauge how long electrophoresis gel should run. The longer the running time, the higher the resolution. However, gel must be manually stopped at desired time based on leading edge marker. If the gel runs too long, sample can run out the bottom of the gel and be lost. This means someone has to be around for the 2-4+ hours the gel is running to stop electrophoresis.
